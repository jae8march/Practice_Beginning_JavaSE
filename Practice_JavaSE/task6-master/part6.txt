Since BrainFuck consists of only these 8 commands, 
building an interpreter for BrainFuck is quite simple. 
In this article, 
we will build a simple program which takes a BrainFuck code 
as input and produces the desired output. 
We will simply accept the BrainFuck code as a String and produce 
the output by parsing the String and checking every character for 
its actual functionality. The memory is represented by an array of byte 
type simulating memory of max 65535 bits from 0 to 65534
(65535 is the highest number which can be represented by an unsigned 
16-bit binary number). 
The variable ptr refers to the current index of the memory array.
